# Świat Anny

## About

A commercial website configured to showcase painted images and contact the site owner via a form in case of questions. In addition, a form for order processing has been added. After placing an order, the user will receive an e-mail confirmation.

The offers section was done using Supabase, so I decided to use and get used to working in GraphQL with the Apollo client, which was a new experience for me.
